# COVID DATA TRACKER PROJECT

In 2021, the world is still fighting against coronavirus while a growing number of people are vaccinated. I have faith that a growing rate of vaccination (of course, on top of social-distancing and various social endeavors) will help us overcome this crisis.
Although there are many helpful data trackers out there, _not many of existing trackers allow me to see coronavirus data and vaccination data right next to each other (on the same page)_.
This is probably because (at the time of doing this project: April 29, 2021) it hasn't been long since the general public in the US became eligible to take covid vaccines.

**Tech Stack** : React (frontend), Firebase (backend), and Material-ui

**Data** : Using the API provided by _disease.sh_,

- totals for new/recovered/death cases were sourced from _Worldometers_
- totals for vaccination were sourced from *https://covid.ourworldindata.org/*
